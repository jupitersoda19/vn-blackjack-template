### Blackjack Integration

The Level Editor allows you to seamlessly integrate blackjack games into your visual novel. Here's how to set up blackjack games in your story:

#### Adding Blackjack to Your Story

1. **Create a Dialog Choice to Start the Game**
   - In any dialog segment, add a choice
   - Set the action type to "Start Game (Blackjack)"
   - Configure the game parameters

2. **Configure Game Parameters**
   - **Player Event Name**: Description of the game (e.g., "High Stakes Game")
   - **Player Cost**: Starting money for the player (e.g., 1000)
   - **Opponent Indices**: Which character(s) to use as opponents
     - Comma-separated list of character indices (e.g., "1,2")
     - First number is the dealer, others are additional opponents
   - **Special Rules**: Optional custom rule variants (e.g., "vegas")

3. **Set Up Post-Game Dialog**
   - Create post-dialog sequences to handle game outcomes
   - Use `{result}` placeholder to display game result
   - Use `{money}` placeholder to show current player money
   - Use `{profit}` placeholder to show player profit

#### Example Blackjack Configuration

```json
{
  "action": "startGame",
  "eventParams": {
    "playerEvent": "High Stakes Game",
    "playerCost": 1000,
    "opponentIndices": [1],
    "opponentEvents": [
      {
        "name": "Dealer Challenge",
        "cost": 5000
      }
    ],
    "specialRules": "vegas",
    "deckCount": 6
  }
}
```

#### Advanced Blackjack Options

- **Multiple Opponents**: Set opponentIndices to multiple character indices
- **Deck Count**: Number of decks used (2-8)
- **Special Rules**: Custom rule variants:
  - "vegas": Las Vegas rules
  - "atlantic": Atlantic City rules
  - "vip": Special VIP rules with better payouts

#### Creating Meaningful Game Outcomes

- **Link Different Events Based on Outcomes**:
  - Create separate events for winning and losing
  - Use choices in post-game dialog to determine next steps
  - Have character reactions change based on results

- **Use Game Results in Dialog**:
  - Refer to the player's winnings/losses in post-game dialog
  - Have characters comment on the player's luck or skill
  - Use conditional text to change dialog based on results

### Creating Conditional Content

The Level Editor supports creating conditional content that changes based on player actions or game state:

#### Using Variables in Dialog

You can use these placeholders in your dialog text:
- `{money}`: Player's current money amount
- `{profit}`: Player's profit from the current session
- `{result}`: Result of the most recent blackjack game

Example:
```
"Wow, you've got ${money} now! That's ${profit} more than when you started!"
```

#### Creating Conditional Choices

1. **Requirement Conditions**: Choices can have requirement conditions
   - Money requirements (e.g., must have at least $1000)
   - Previous event requirements (e.g., must have completed a specific event)

2. **Money-Gated Options**: Create choices that only appear when the player has enough money
   - Great for "high roller" options
   - Encourages players to earn more in blackjack games

3. **Branching Based on Success**: Create different story paths based on blackjack performance
   - Success path for consistently winning players
   - Alternative path for players who struggle

### Advanced Techniques

#### Using URL-Loaded Assets

You can load assets from external URLs by entering the complete URL path in the asset fields:

```
https://example.com/your-images/background.jpg
```

This allows you to:
- Host assets on image hosting services
- Use CDNs for better performance
- Share adventures without bundling large asset files
- Create dynamic content that can be updated remotely

#### Split/Merge Game Files

The editor allows you to split your game into multiple JSON files or merge separate files:

**Splitting**:
1. Import your complete game
2. Click "Split" in the Export dialog
3. Choose which components to extract (events, metadata)
4. Download the separate files

**Merging**:
1. Click "Merge" in the Import dialog
2. Upload multiple JSON files (events, metadata, etc.)
3. The editor will combine them into a complete game
4. Resolve any conflicts (duplicate event keys, etc.)

#### Advanced Dialog Features

**Text Animation**: Add animation to your dialog text:
- "fadeIn": Text fades in
- "typewriter": Text appears character by character
- "none": Text appears immediately

**Background Transitions**: Add transitions between scenes:
- "fade": Smooth fade transition
- "slide": Slide transition from one side
- "fadeToBlack": Fade to black first, then show new background

**Background Effects**: Add visual effects to backgrounds:
- "particles": Particle effects (e.g., snow, rain)
- "ambient-light": Subtle light effects
- "weather": Weather effects (rain, snow, etc.)

**Sound Effects**: Add sound effects to dialog:
- Single sounds: Play once when dialog appears
- Ambient sounds: Loop during the dialog
- Multiple sounds: Play multiple sounds in sequence

**Character Animations**: Animate characters in scenes:
- "entering": Character enters the scene
- "exiting": Character leaves the scene
- "close": Character moves closer to the center
- "very-close": Character moves very close (for intimate scenes)

#### Event Flow Control

**Reset Variables**: Reset game variables at specific points:
```json
"resetVariables": true
```

**Carry Over Money**: Choose whether to carry over money between events:
```json
"usePreviousMoney": true
```

**Global Variables**: Set and check global variables for advanced branching:
```json
"setVariables": {
  "metDealer": true,
  "wonFirstGame": true
}
```

### Best Practices and Tips

#### File and Asset Organization

- **Consistent Naming Convention**:
  - Use lowercase with underscores for spaces
  - Include character name and emotion in filenames
  - Example: `dealer_happy.png`, `dealer_angry.png`

- **Folder Structure**:
  - `/assets/backgrounds/`: All background images
  - `/assets/characters/`: Character images (grouped by character)
  - `/assets/sounds/`: Sound effects and music
  - `/assets/icons/`: UI elements and icons

- **Asset Optimization**:
  - Compress images to reduce file size
  - Use PNG for characters needing transparency
  - Use JPG for backgrounds and photos
  - Keep audio files under 1MB when possible

#### Story Structure

- **Linear with Branches**:
  - Start with a main storyline
  - Add branches at key decision points
  - Ensure all branches eventually rejoin or reach endings
  - Use the Flow Graph to visualize and check connections

- **Progressive Difficulty**:
  - Start with lower stakes blackjack games
  - Increase stakes as the player progresses
  - Lock higher stake tables behind money requirements
  - Create "comeback" opportunities if player loses money

- **Engaging Characters**:
  - Give each character a distinct personality
  - Ensure characters react to game outcomes
  - Create relationship development based on player choices
  - Use different emotions to express character reactions

#### Game Balance

- **Choice Consequences**:
  - Make choices meaningful with real consequences
  - Use money requirements to gate certain paths
  - Create different endings based on player performance
  - Allow both winning and losing paths to be interesting

  - Test each event individually before linking
  - Verify all asset paths work correctly
  - Check all dialog for errors and typos
  - Test all branches and endings
  - Use Asset Manager to identify issues

- **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
  - Missing or incorrect asset paths
  - Broken links between events
  - Forgetting to set "nextEvent" properties
  - Dialog text placeholders not being replaced
